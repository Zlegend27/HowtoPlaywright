    The basic test structure in Playwright consists of a test() function, 
which defines indivisual test cases. If we want to use more then one 
test case in a single test file, it's good practice to group them using 
test.describe() function

    The test() function is executed in Playwright environment that launches
the browser and provides a fresh page for each test. 

test.describe() : declares a group of tests

test() : defines indivisual test cases, and helps the runner launch the browser 
          using { page } fixture. 

    In Playwright, the setup and teardown of browser instances are managed automatically
by the Playwright Test Runner. When a Playwright test is executed, the test runner 
automatically creates a new browser context and page for each test. As a result, 
you don't need to worry about explicitly launching or closing browsers for each test.
